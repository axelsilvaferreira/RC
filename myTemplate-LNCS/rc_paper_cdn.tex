\section{Introduction}									%(Axel)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\subsection{Context}
\lettrine[lines=2]{T}{he} Internet has its origins in the early 1980's and presented an exponential growth when commercial companies started to link to the existing academic and military networks during the 90's. As the popularity of the Internet increased the number of devices connected started to see an exponential growth.\\ 
% \subsection{Problems }
At that time [analogue] networks were unreliable and internet communication protocols were designed in a robust fashion. As an example, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was designed to survive multiple packet losses and thus being a very chatty protocol, there are multiple Round-trip Time (RTTs) this causes a latency problem over long distance communication.
Modern [digital] networks are faster and more reliable, but most of the core protocols mentioned above don't take advantage of the increased reliability.
% @@@@ DUE TO Backwards compatibility ? @@@@
As the Internet role in daily life grew, new technologies star to emerge providing images videos and other dynamic content. This caused a bottleneck in servers with popular content.
The above problems, led to the development Content Delivery Networks.

%\subsection{What is a CDN?}
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a large network of distributed storage servers which cash the content in multiple locations strategically spread. Traditionally CDN servers are stored in ISP's facilities. This reduces both infrastructural costs to CDN Providers and ISP's costs by keeping popular content local, in contrast to bringing it from another ISP's network.

%\subsection{How does it Work?}
A CDN works by keeping a copy of the content in different locations. Whenever content is requested, management software calculates the best Server for accessing the content. This reduces distance to server which improves latency and minimizes packet loss. 
Since the calculations are dynamic, in case of a server malfunction another Server is chosen, providing redundancy.
%\subsection{CDN Service vs in House Solution}
Traditional CDN business model target bandwidth as a cost factor. This brings two advantages over a 'In House' solution. First, there are no initial infrastructural costs, and second, provides bandwidth on demand. In comparison with an 'In House' solution, there is no need to deal with both predictable and unpredictable traffic peaks.
Due to its large distributed infrastructure, and high bandwidth on demand CDNs are especially well suited to absorve a Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
%\subsection{Costs}
One thing to keep in mind 
With all the above in mind, CDNs < (costs + performance)
still expensive

\subsection{Purpose} %Propósito do paper
This paper's purpose is to provide organised information about different CDN architectures: the traditional large server infrastructure CDN, the Peer to Peer (P2P) CDN and a new Hybrid architecture which relies on both Servers and Peers. 
	
	
	
	
	
	1 - overview das 3 arquitecturas principais
		Objetivo do paper - num único texto (organizar informação)
			- impacto das CDN na sociedade (âmbitos de aplicação)
			- dado o impacto social das CDN => é importante reduzir os custos associados ás CDN (infraestruturas) de forma a permitir que um numero maior de empresas (de pequena e media dimensão) ou particulares possam usufruir delas. =>impacto Redução da carga nas internet

The following list contains the most popular CDN service providers. According to \cite{reuters}, Akamai, being the biggest CDN provider, and is responsible for as much as 15\%-30\% of the internet traffic.

Another interesting perspective is to evaluate the offerings available. Most of them are commercial CDNs. 


-O paper "Standard IPTV CDN Architecture Interfaces" Fala sobre desafios
		º Falta de standards
		º Incompatibilidade entre as CDNs existentes (impossibilita a mobilidade)
		%-Lack of standards and Norms => hard to change provider

nossa perspetiva
-Arquitectura híbrida 

- a contribuição única é o paper focado nos custos gerais em função das diferentes arquiteturas

-Referir que este paper está limitado á perspetiva da bibliografia
